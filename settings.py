### General settings
CAMERA_INDEX = 0            # OpenCV camera index. If there is only one camera attached, this will be 0
VIEW_ANGLE_Y=0.785          # Vertical view angle of the camera used (in radians)

### Scanning settings
LASER_THRESHOLD = 50        # Difference threshold (in brightness values ranging 0-255) for distinguishing laser points
                            # (Lower in case of false positives, increase in case of false negatives)
DETECTION='diff'            # Detection method for points, can be 
                            # 'brightness' to use any bright point, 
                            # 'red' for using red points ,
                            # 'diff' for brightness difference between laser on and laser off
ROTATION_STEP=2*math.pi/200 # Angle of a single step of the scanning platform's stepper motor (in radians)
FRAMES_PER_STEP=1           # How many frames to take and average for every step

### Output settings
SCALE=.1                    # Scale the created object by this factor
FILL_HOLES=True             # Interpolate gaps in measured data (per step) Note: this breaks everything for complex objects
MAKE_FACES=True             # Create faces on the output model, output is a point cloud if this is set to False
